Version 2.0  -  2011/01/01
===========

Since there were maior feature upgrades since version 1.0 I release the new
version as BG-Tiny Linux Bootdisk 2.0. The changes since the last public
release are:


Updated the Linux kernel and dosfstools to the latest versions and added
support for the filesystem cramfs and for the loopback device.

Added plip support to be able to transfer data over a parallel-port Laplink
cable. This makes is possible to use BG-Tiny Linux Bootdisk to install
either an old windows version or a linux-2.4 Debian Linux version (eg Woody
or Lenny) on an old 4MB-RAM computer which does not have or has an
unsupported cdrom-drive.

There is free ram of 1168kb and the total amount of free ram 
(free low ram + buffers + cached) is now 1556kb on a machine with
4MB of total ram.


Added oneit_lite 1.0

Updated dosfstools to 3.0.11
Updated linux kernel to 2.4.37.11

Removed toybox 0.1.0


Released Floppy Version.
Please report bugs to BG-TLB@Giannone.de


Version 1.1
===========

Updated the Linux kernel and dosfstools to the latest versions.

Added support for the filesystem cramfs and for the loopback device which
both can proove usefull when you want to decompress a Linux-2.4 Debian initrd
to a spare partition to do a manual install.

Added plip support to be able to transfer data over a parallel-port Laplink
cable. This makes is possible to use BG-Tiny Linux Bootdisk to install
either an old windows version or a linux-2.4 Debian Linux version (eg Woody
or Lenny) on an old 4MB-RAM computer which does not have or has an
unsupported cdrom-drive.

Added the script /sbin/network to set up the loopback network and to explain
how to setup plip-network an how to transfer data using netcat. 

BG-Tiny Linux Bootdisk is now a full install tool for old computers with 4MB
of ram. To perform an eg Windows95 installation on a computer without a
cdrom drive you are able to: fdisk, format (mkdosfs/mkfs.fat32), make bootable
(ms-sys), copy the installation files over parallel-link network (nc/plip) and
finally to reboot and install the system.

To perform a Linux-2.4 Debian GNU/Linux (eg Woody or Lenny) installation on
a computer without a cdrom drive you are able to: fdisk, create 
spare/swap/root partitions, format (mke2fs/mkswap), make bootable (lilo),
copy the installation files over network (nc,plip), extract the initrd into
the spare disk (cramfs/loop) and finally to reboot and install the system.

Using oneit_lite instead of the oneit from toybox. This saves 9kb of
diskspace and some ram. UPXed lilo, this saves 92kb of disk space.

All this modifications of course cost some ram and we have less free ram
than with BG-Tiny Linux Bootdisk 1.0. But compared to the 0.x versions we
still have much more ram left. The free ram is 1168kb and the total amount of
free ram (free low ram + buffers + cached) is now 1556kb on a machine with
4MB of total ram.


Included the following new kernel drivers: cramfs, parport. plip.

Included the following new busybox applets: ifconfig, losetup.


Added oneit_lite 1.0

Updated dosfstools to 3.0.11
Updated linux kernel to 2.4.37.11

Removed toybox 0.1.0


This version was never released.


Version 1.0  -  2010/11/29
===========

Released Version 0.9.1 as 1.0 without further changes. The changes since the
last public release are:


Recompiled and updated the whole system to be a little more up to date. All
binaries are statically against uClibc 0.9.27. The system should still run
on an i386 (no FPU) with as little as 4MB of RAM.

Updated the linux kernel 2.4, dosfstools and ms-sys to the most recent
versions. Integrated some of the BG-Rescue Linux patches. 

Changed the init structure to use less memory and therefore included oneit
from Toybox.

Changed the keymap script a little to be more selfexplaining and to
automatically delete the keymaps also in cases of failure or if the default
keymap is used. Added swiss keyboard layouts.

After booting there are 1560kb of free ram on a machine with 4MB ram.


Added toybox 0.1.0

Updated dosfstools to 3.0.10
Updated linux kernel to 2.4.37.10
Updated ms-sys to 2.2.0

Readded busybox 1.3.2
Readded gpart 0.1h
Readded lilo 22.8


Released Floppy Version.
Please report bugs to BG-TLB@Giannone.de


Version 0.9.1
=============

Recompiled the whole system and linked it statically against uClibc 0.9.27.
Now the system should run again on an i386 with as little as 4MB of RAM.

Readded busybox 1.3.2
Readded dosfstools 3.0.10
Readded gpart 0.1h
Readded lilo 22.8
Readded ms-sys 2.2.0
Readded toybox 0.1.0


This version was never released.


Version 0.9
===========

Recompiled and updated the whole system to a little more up to date. For the
moment linked all programs statically against uClibc 0.9.31. This has to
change again because this library in the used configuration needs at least
an i486 and our goal ist clearly to support i386 (even SX).

Updated the linux kernel 2.4, dosfstools and ms-sys to the most recent
versions. Integrated some of the BG-Rescue Linux patches. 

Changed the init structure to use less memory and therefore included oneit
from Toybox.

Changed the keymap script a little to be more selfexplaining and to
automatically delete the keymaps also in cases of failure or if the default
keymap is used. Added swiss keyboard layouts.

Version 0.8  -  2008/05/04
===========

Updated the Linux kernel to 2.4.36.3.

Removed the devfsd applet from busybox since it is not needed any more.

Removed the init applet from busybox and compiled an extra busybox
containing only init and halt/poweroff/reboot. This saves a lot of ram since
not all busybox code has to be kept in ram when running init. It uses more
disk space but there is still some left...

When compared to version 0.7 the total amount of free ram (free low ram +
buffers + cached) is now 844kb instead 772kb on a machine with 4 MB of ram.
This is an improvement of free RAM of 72kb!

Released Floppy Version.
Please report bugs to BG-TLB@Giannone.de


Version 0.7  -  2008/04/27
===========

UPXed the kernel with "--all-methods --all-filters --best". This saves some
more kilobytes of diskspace.

Recompiled busybox and linked it staticly against uClibc 0.9.27. This saves
some more kilobytes of diskspace. Activated the askfirst feature to start
shells on additional terminals only when needed. This saves quite a lot of
ram.

Recompiled the whole system and linked it staticly against uClibc 0.9.27.
This saves some more kilobytes of diskspace and makes further developement
easier.

Recompiled busybox and added the unzip applet.

When compared to version 0.6 the total amount of free ram (free low ram +
buffers + cached) is now 772kb instead 672kb on a machine with 4 MB of ram.
This is an improvement of free RAM of 100kb!

Released Floppy Version.
Please report bugs to BG-TLB@Giannone.de


Version 0.6  -  2008/04/20
===========

Compressed the linux kernel with upx. Even if I wanted to avoid upx this is
still a good idea because this will not affect the system once booted. And
the system still boots happily with 4MB RAM. There is exactly the same
amount of free ram like before. And there is a little more disk space.

Added ms-sys 2.1.3 (statically linked).

Since partition tools like fdisk and the e2fsprogs are included into busybox
and we include separately dosfsprogs, gpart and ms-sys we now have a pretty
complete rescue system for computers with very low ram.

Supported filesystems are ext2, ext3, iso9660 and vfat.

The system should boot on any 386 (fpu not neccessary) with at least 4 MB RAM.

Released the first Floppy Version.
Please report bugs to BG-TLB@Giannone.de


Version 0.5
===========

Added a little welcome message to the beginning of the boot process. So the
user knows what system he is starting...

Added dosfsprogs 2.11-2.3 with debian patches (statically linked).
Added gpart 0.1h-4.1 with debian patches (statically linked).

Recompiled lilo 22.8 and removed some unneeded config options:
-DEVMS -DREISERFS -DVIRTUAL -DDEVMAPPER

This version was never released.


Version 0.4
===========

Added linux kernel 2.4.36.2 with the patches from BG-Rescue Linux.

Added a little kernel patch to make it possible to boot without user
interaction. This would be needed normally because when one uses /dev/fd0 as
root device the kernel change_floppy mechanism is activated.

Added /sbin/help a little utility to list the available programs. This is a
good idea because there are no bisybox symlinks to save space. So one would
assume that there are almost no programs included.

Added many new keyboard layouts for the user to choose one at boot time. The
used ones are the familiar ones from BG-Rescue Linux. This does not waste
much space and is very comfortable. At least it does not use additional ram.

This version was never released.


Version 0.3
===========

Changed the bootloader to extlinux a version of syslinux which is suited to
boot from an ext2 file system.

Added the vfat filesystem along with the needed codepages for accessing
dos/windows filesystems.

Removed serial port support.
Removed devfs support.

Using an old style static /dev directory again. This saves quite a lot of
ram. Unfortunatelly it uses space on the floppy but fortunatelly not too
much ;-) ...

This version was never released.


Version 0.2
===========

Addes some new busybox applets: loadkmap, devfsd.
Switched the logging modes to silent.

Not using devfsd because it needs too much ram. The goal is to use only 4 MB
of RAM for the whole system.

Updated the scripts in etc and some symlinks in /sbin and /bin. The system
is more comfortable now.

Using german keymap.

This version was never released.


Version 0.1
===========

This is the initial release of BG-TinyLinuxBootdisk (BG-TLB) my fork of Tiny
Linux Bootdisk (TLB). The functionality should now be almost the same. 

BG-TLB is a very small rescue linux system which runs from one single floppy
disk without using a ramdisk. So it can run on systems with *very little*
ram. The negative part is that you can't remove the floppy disk.

The advantage is that we use a newer busybox version and static linking.
Therefore we can save much space and achive the same functionality without
compressing with UPX on a single 1.4MB floppy disk. And we have some free
space left for cool things.

Included the following programs:
busybox 1.3.2 (statically linked akainst uClibc 0.9.24)
lilo 22.8 with some tlb patches (statically linked akainst uClibc 0.9.24)

This version was never released.
